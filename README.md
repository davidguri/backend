# Backend
This is the code for the backend project I'm working on while attending an internship at Helius Systems Shpk.

During this internship and my work on this project, I learned a lot about backend development, specifically relationships in PostgreSQL databases, how to manage authentication using JWT tokens securely, type-safety, and more.
